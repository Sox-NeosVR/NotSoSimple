# NotSoSimple

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/). This mod adds options to add a few extra stages of protection to 'SimpleAvatarProtection'.

**!!!THIS IS NOT A FOOL PROOF SOLUTION!!!**

**!!!THIS WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY PROTECT YOUR ASSETS!!!**

**WE ARE NOT RELIABLE FOR STOLEN ASSETS WHILE RUNNING THIS MOD**

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [NotSoSimple.dll](https://github.com/Sox-NeosVR/NotSimple/releases/latest/download/NotSoSimple.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
